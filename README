This is an extension to an old University project of mine. The initial design will be for a system that puts tests and compares search algorithms, using a plugin architecture to allow algorithms to be added easily.

I have vague hopes of it eventually becoming a generic genetic programming tool.

Initially .Net 4.5 and C#. Some F# will undoubtedly come in handy too.

It doesn't do very much yet, so don't expect anything other than some initial code for now.
